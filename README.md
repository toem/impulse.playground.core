# impulse Core Playground

A compact playground to explore impulse core features: records, signals, expressions, processing, and views. It ships sample data in three formats plus ready-to-use starter views.

## Introduction to impulse

impulse is a visualization and analysis workbench for signals from logs, traces, and simulations. It helps you inspect large datasets efficiently and tailor presentations for your workflow.

- Records: Hierarchical containers with scopes and elements (signals, includes, analysis, interfaces).  
- Signals: Sequences of samples along a domain (typically time). Supported types include logic, float, integer, enum/event, text, array, struct, and binary.  
- Views: Reusable presentations that combine signals, folders, and diagrams (line, gantt, event, charts). Views support multiple axes and cursors. Processing is on demand—only visible parts are computed, and collapsed folders don’t trigger processing.  
- Processing & automation: Readers/producers build records; processors and expressions derive or filter signals; value formats and labels control textual rendering.

## What’s Here

- 1 logic (recMlMz): RTL/SystemC wave dumps as .recMl (XML) and .recMz (compressed) records.
- 2 flux traces (recTr): Flux SimpleC trace files showcasing all signal types and compression. 
- 3 expressions (recJx): Records generated by expression producers (scripts).

## Formats at a Glance

- recMl: XML-based record files containing packed signal data (good for readability and diffs).
- recMz: Compressed binary variant of recMl (smaller, faster to load).
- recTr: Flux trace container from C examples (supports all types: integer/float/logic/enum/text/array/struct/event; can be compressed with LZ4 or FLZ→LZ4).
- recJx: Expression-based scripts that generate records on the fly via the impulse expression engine.

## Quick Start

1) Open any sample file (recMl/recMz/recTr/recJx) in impulse.
2) Click Open Views and pick a matching starter view (see below).
3) Need help? See the impulse manual for guided tours, feature deep-dives, and troubleshooting: https://toem.io/category/resources/impulse-manual/. Recommended sections: Introduction, impulse at a Glance, and Views.

## Folder Highlights

### 1 Logic (recMlMz)

Waveform-like records with scopes and many logic signals. The OVERVIEW lists datasets from tiny (logic01) to very large (logic29). It also shows compression gains, e.g. logic19: 6.1 MB recMl → 755 KB recMz; logic29: 5.1 MB recMl → 117 KB recMz. Time bases vary (fs/ps/ns/us/ms).

See: [1 logic (recMlMz)/OVERVIEW.md](1%20logic%20%28recMlMz%29/OVERVIEW.md)

### 2 Flux Traces (recTr)

Trace series trace01…trace12 demonstrating: integers, floats, text, enums/events (Gantt), logic (bit/vector/scattered), arrays, structs, and mixed content. Typical set size is 50k samples. Compression steps progress from none (01–08) to LZ4 (10–11) and a pipeline FLZ→LZ4 (12). Time base is ns for 01–10 and ms for 11–12.

See: [2 flux traces (recTr)/OVERVIEW.md](2%20flux%20traces%20%28recTr%29/OVERVIEW.md)

### 3 Expressions (recJx)

Scripts for synthetic records: sine/cosine, random waveforms, buses/control, ISR/task Gantt patterns, event relations, structs/arrays, label and color mappings. Time base varies (ns/ms) per example.

## Starter Views (Predefined)

Pick one that matches the file you open (links below open the sample files).

- logic01 — Open: [logic01.recMl](1%20logic%20%28recMlMz%29/logic01.recMl)
	- Signals: clk0001, rst0001, reg0001…reg0005.
	- Diagrams: line (interpolated/annotated examples) and gantt.
	- "Opcodes" gantt uses a label mapping (valueFormat) to name opcodes.
	- Includes cursor A and Primary/Secondary axes.
- logic02 — Open: [logic02.recMl](1%20logic%20%28recMlMz%29/logic02.recMl)
	- View tree mirrors the record scopes (large set of regs/wires/clk/parameters).
	- Derived signals:
		- Combined (logic) referencing //view/clk0001 and //view/reg0069; deduces bit 9 labeled "on".
		- Extracted (logicExtract) with count=4 and swap=true (split bits/nibbles).
		- Grouped (deduce grouped=4) to visualize vector groups.
		- Filtered (expressionFilter) with domain window 1us–3us, binary format, attachments kept, and log output.
	- Includes cursor A and Primary/Secondary axes.
- trace11 — Open: [trace11.recTr](2%20flux%20traces%20%28recTr%29/trace11.recTr)
	- Shows all major types: integer/short/llong (line), event (event), float/double (line), logic bit/vector/scattered, struct, arrays.
	- Arrays expose components via deduced channels (.x/.y). Includes a "View Signal" referencing //view/integer[2].
	- Processors: expressionFilter on struct (m0 == 0), simple expression (*s1 + *s2), statement-based expressions with logging and output panel.
	- Includes cursor A and Primary/Secondary axes.
- expression01 — Open: [expression01.recJx](3%20expressions%20%28recJx%29/expression01.recJx)
	- Charts: Sin (line, categorized), Bar1 (bar), Pie (cutout+legend+categorized), Bar2 (stacked+transposed), Radar (title+legend+categorized+cutout), Line3/Line4 (filled/stacked/transposed variants).
	- XY thinning via expressionFilter: keep every 1000th sample (index % 1000 == 0), transposed axes, maxCategories=2000.
- expression10 — Open: [expression10.recJx](3%20expressions%20%28recJx%29/expression10.recJx)
	- Two struct signals (Struct1/Struct2) with an expressionFilter applied to Struct1 for selective viewing.
